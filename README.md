# AMPLab-musicology: Makam vs Raga comparison pitch-class-histogram analysis for Huseyni 

Musicology project for Audio and Music Processing Lab course at UPF Barcelona 2018-19

Pitch class histograms were obtained for the symbolic Scores of Turkish Makam Huyseyni and Pitch data of Raga Husaini from Hindustani Music corpus.

Using the similarity between the two as a basis of their musical similarity, an attempt was made to establish a link between them to trace the origin of Indian Raga Husaini to the makam Huseyni as described in historical texts.
